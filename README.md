## Tips

There are environment variable to override the default value of host, port, username and password
- `MC_BOT_HOST` for the host (String)
- `MC_BOT_PORT` for the port (Integer)
- `MC_BOT_USERNAME` for the email/username (String)
- `MC_BOT_PREMIUM` to specify if the Microsoft Authentication should be used (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_DEBUG` for the debug mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_PREFIX` for the prefix of the commands (default=`.`) (String)
- `MC_BOT_AUTO_RECONNECT` for the auto reconnect mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_RECONNECT_DELAY` for the delay before reconnect (Integer)

They are some builtin commands in the bot

- `difficulty` get the difficulty of the server
- `food` get the food level of the player
- `help` get all the available commands, their description and their usage
- `health` get the health of the player
- `list` get the players connected (Sometimes the packet is glitched, you can use the status button go get the players)
- `pos` get the player position
- `disconnect` disconnect the bot

## Command Line Interface

<p> Like the GUI, the CLI can use commands and send message to the server </p>
<p> Simply type anything in the CLI and type enter</p>

```
 -a,--autoReconnect             Activate auto reconnect
 -d,--debug                     Activate debug
 -h,--host <arg>                Setup the host value (Default=127.0.0.1)
    --help                      Show this help page
 -p,--port <arg>                Setup the port value (Default=25565)
    --premium                   Activate the Microsoft Authentication
    --reconnectDelay <arg>      Delay before reconnection
 -s,--status                    Display only the status of the server
 -u,--user <arg>                Email/Username of the user
```

## Termux Guide

This project works great with [Termux](https://termux.com/). You can use the CLI to operate from your phone. 
Here, is the guide to run this project on Termux. 

### First-Time Setup

* Download and install Termux from [here](https://termux.com/).
* Run `pkg install openjdk-17 curl jq -y`
* Run ⬇️
```bash
curl -o MinecraftBOT.jar -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/alwyn974/MinecraftBOT/releases/latest | jq -r ".assets[0].browser_download_url")
```

### Starting The Bot

Now you can run the MinecraftBOT, see [CLI Options](https://github.com/alwyn974/MinecraftBOT#command-line-interface)

Example: `java -jar MinecraftBOT.jar --host play.hypixel.net --autoReconnect --user Notch`

### Stopping The Bot

There is some method of stopping the bot in Termux:
- Write `.disconnect` in the CLI (`.` is the default prefix for the commands)
- See the termux notification bar, and close it
- Force Stop the application (not recommanded)
